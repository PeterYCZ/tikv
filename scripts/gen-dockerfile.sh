# This Docker image contains a minimal build environment for TiKV
#
# It contains all the tools necessary to reproduce official production builds of TiKV

# We need to use CentOS 7 because many of our users choose this as their deploy machine.
# Since the glibc it uses (2.17) is from 2012 (https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Glibc%20Timeline)
# it is our lowest common denominator in terms of distro support.

# Some commands in this script are structured in order to reduce the number of layers Docker
# generates. Unfortunately Docker is limited to only 125 layers:

# We require epel packages, so enable the fedora EPEL repo then install dependencies.
# Install the system dependencies
# Attempt to clean and rebuild the cache to avoid 404s
